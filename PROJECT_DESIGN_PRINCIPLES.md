# 💎 PROJECT DESIGN PRINCIPLES

## 🏗️ Overview

This document defines the strict architectural and engineering principles for the **MLTeammate** project. These rules ensure robust, maintainable, and scalable development throughout all phases.

---

## ✅ Principle 1: "Freeze then Extend"

### Definition

> **Once a phase of code is finalized and fully tested, it is *frozen*. All subsequent phases must adapt to integrate with the frozen code, not the other way around.**

### Purpose

* Prevent constant rewriting of working code.
* Avoid architecture drift and confusion.
* Ensure each milestone is reliable and traceable.

### Allowed Changes

* Only critical bug fixes (not design changes) may modify frozen phases.
* All feature additions must remain compatible with frozen interfaces.

---

## ✅ Principle 2: Clear Phase-Based Development

### Process

* Divide work into clear phases (e.g., Search, Evaluation, Logging, Extensions).
* Complete and freeze each phase before starting the next.
* Document each phase completion checkpoint in git (e.g., tags: `v1_search_eval_frozen`).

---

## ✅ Principle 3: Explicit Interface Contracts

### Definition

* Method names, arguments, return types, and class structures must be clearly defined and documented before starting each phase.
* Once frozen, interfaces cannot be changed.

---

## ✅ Principle 4: Strict Module Boundaries

### Rules

* Each module (e.g., Search, Controller, Callbacks) must be fully self-contained and reusable.
* Cross-module dependencies must be explicit and minimal.
* Avoid hidden side effects between modules.

---

## ✅ Principle 5: Automated Testing for Each Phase

### Requirements

* Every major feature must include corresponding unit tests and integration tests.
* Tests must pass before freezing the phase.
* Bug fixes require new or updated tests to prevent regressions.

---

## ✅ Principle 6: Transparent Logging & Tracking

### Implementation

* Use logger callbacks and MLflow (or future systems) to track each trial and experiment.
* Maintain reproducibility through fixed seeds and logged configurations.

---

## 💬 Final Declaration

> “We commit to sustainable, phase-based, and interface-frozen development to ensure that MLTeammate remains robust, extensible, and easy to debug and maintain.”

---

## 🚩 Version Control & Snapshots

* Use `git tag` or branches to mark frozen points clearly.
* Example:

  ```
  git tag v1_search_eval_frozen
  git push origin v1_search_eval_frozen
  ```

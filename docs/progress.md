# 📈 MLTeammate – Project Progress Tracker

This document helps track the overall vision, completed milestones, current tasks, and upcoming goals for the MLTeammate project.  
Use this to maintain clarity, motivation, and alignment with the long-term roadmap.

---

## 🧩 Project Vision

MLTeammate is an **open-source AutoML teammate** designed to be:

- Transparent 🪞 (no black-boxes)
- Modular 🧱 (plug-in learners, searchers, metrics)
- Research-ready 🧪 (easy experiment tracking & customization)
- Beginner-friendly 🚀 (educational code structure & tutorials)

It aims to serve as a personal and collaborative ML companion.

- [x] Learner abstraction (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- [x] Config space definition (`config_spaces.py`)
- [x] `OptunaSearch` class
- [x] Basic metrics module (`metrics.py`)
- [x] Training + `.score()` compatibility

### 📊 Evaluation + Utility
- [x] Cross-validation support
- [x] sklearn-like `.fit()` and `.score()` API
- [x] Internal logging with trial tracking
- [x] Functional test with synthetic data
- [x] `01_quickstart_basic.py` complete

### 📚 Documentation
- [x] Project `README.md`
- [x] This `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` tracker
- [x] Clear project structure and examples

## ✅ Recently Completed

### 🧪 Enhanced Logging and Callback System
- [x] **Enhanced Callback System**: Complete rewrite with structured logging, progress tracking, and artifact management
- [x] **LoggerCallback**: Advanced logging with MLflow integration, log levels, and file output
- [x] **ProgressCallback**: Real-time progress bars, ETA calculations, and early stopping suggestions
- [x] **ArtifactCallback**: Automatic model saving, configuration dumps, and artifact management
- [x] **Factory Functions**: Easy callback creation with `create_callbacks()`

### 🧪 Tutorials & Examples
- [x] `02_with_cross_validation.py` - Complete with proper CV integration
- [x] `03_with_mlflow.py` - Full MLflow integration with artifact support and feature importance plots
- [x] `04_add_custom_learner.py` - Comprehensive custom learner tutorial with 3 examples
- [x] `05_optuna_search_example.py` - Advanced Optuna features including multi-objective optimization

### 📁 Documentation
- [x] `docs/installation.md` - Comprehensive installation guide with troubleshooting
- [x] `docs/getting_started.md` - Complete getting started guide with examples
- [x] `docs/extending.md` - Detailed extension guide for contributors

## 🔄 Current Focus

### 🧪 Testing and Validation
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite for new callback system
- [ ] Integration tests for all tutorials
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## 📌 Next Steps

### ✍️ Core Features (High Priority)
- [ ] Add FLAMLSearch (optional fallback searcher)
- [ ] Add LightGBMLearner abstraction
- [ ] Allow user-defined scoring functions
- [ ] Handle multi-class and regression tasks better

### 🧪 Experiments
- [ ] Add MLflow experiment tracking support
- [ ] Enable saving/loading best models via `controller.save_model()`  

### 🧠 Smart Features (Phase 2)
